<div id="describe-text">
  <p>I am a data scientist interested in human behaviour, especially in strategic and altruistic scenarios. In my PhD, I have performed behavioural experiments with humans in social dilemmas (e.g., public goods and common-pool resources games) and other games. I have also explored theoretical models trying to understand the evolution of cooperation.  See the <a href="{{ '/publications' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Publications</a> section for more details. I am also deeply interested in statistical methods, complex systems and network science, and software development.
