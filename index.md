  <p markdown="1">I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Zaragoza](https://www.unizar.es/), and a member of the [COSNET](https://cosnet.bifi.es/) and [Nectunt](https://nectunt.bifi.es/) Labs. I am mainly interested in understanding human behaviour through behavioural experiments, game theory, data analysis, and agent-based models.  </p>

<p markdown="1">
In my PhD, I have performed experiments exploring people's strategic and altruistic responses in games (e.g., Common-Pool Resources and Public Goods games). Moreover, I have also worked with theoretical models exploring the mechanisms behind the evolution of cooperative behaviour. I received my undergraduate and master's degrees in Computer Science from the [University of Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/), and during my master, I analysed data from the Twitter Social Network. Before that, I have worked as a software developer for seven years, developing software for mobile platforms and web applications.
