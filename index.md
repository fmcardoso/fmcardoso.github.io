<p markdown="1">I am a complex system researcher and data scientist. I have recently defended my PhD thesis at the [University of Zaragoza](https://www.unizar.es/). As a member of the [COSNET](https://cosnet.bifi.es/) and [Nectunt](https://nectunt.bifi.es/) Labs, I studied human behaviour through behavioural experiments, game theory, data analysis, and agent-based models.  In my PhD, I have developed and performed experiments exploring people's strategic and altruistic behaviour. Moreover, I have also worked with theoretical models exploring the mechanisms behind the evolution of cooperation.

I received my undergraduate and master's degrees in Computer Science from the [University of Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/). During my master, as a member of the [Laboratory of Information Systems](https://lis-unicamp.github.io/), I analysed the topical alignment of Twitter users. Before that, I have worked as a software developer for seven years, developing software for mobile platforms and web applications.
