  <p markdown="1">I am a PhD candidate at the [COSNET Lab](https://cosnet.bifi.es/) in the [University of Zaragoza](https://www.unizar.es/). I am mainly interested in understanding human behaviour through economics experiments, data analysis, and agent-based models.  </p>

<p markdown="1">
In my PhD, I have performed behavioural experiments with humans in scenarios exploring their strategic and altruistic responses in economic games. Moreover, I have also worked with theoretical models exploring the mechanisms behind the evolution of pro-social behaviour. I received my undergraduate and master's degrees in Computer Science from the [University of Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/), and during my master I analysed data from the Twitter Social Network. Before that, I have worked as a software developer for seven years, developing software for mobile platforms and web applications.
